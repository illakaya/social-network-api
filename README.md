# social-network-api
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Description

This project was constructed in order to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list using Express.js for routing, dayjs for date formatting a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Through this project, I learnt about:

- NoSQL MongoDB and Collections
- Documents, subdocuments and embedded documents
- CRUD Mongoose 
- Models, Schemas and Instances
- Aggregates and Virtuals

The image below shows the back-end in Insomnia.
